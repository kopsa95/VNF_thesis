Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) are enabling network programmability and the automated provisioning of virtual networking services. Combining these new paradigms can overcome the limitations of traditional clouds
and networks by enhancing their dynamic networking capabilities. Since these evolutions
have motivated this thesis and our investigations, this chapter on the state of the art will
provide an overview of NFV architecture, SDN, resource allocation challenges and reflect
the convergence trend between cloud computing, software networks, and the virtualization
of networking functions.
