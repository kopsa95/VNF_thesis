The proposed scheme (developed algorithms on a simulation environment)  coordinate services well and achieve service quality comparable to a state of-the-art centralized coordination goal. At the same
time, they require less or no global network information, are
faster, can be massively parallelized, and are more robust to
failures. We  believe
that an algorithmic approach can significantly improve service
coordination and resulting QoS in practice.

The experimental results, which have been carried out through , demonstrate how the proposed method can have an impact in a more automated SF coordination without manual actions

We developed a simulated NFV network on a real network topology. We simulated the VNF connectivity and we provided the test results.
