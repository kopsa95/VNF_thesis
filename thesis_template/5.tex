In future work, we can investigate more algorithms to implement in this environment and even an AI-oriented (Artificial Intelligence) decision making approach.
As well, we can look in  hybrid approaches, where some coordination decisions are
made centrally and others in a distributed manner.

But one thing is for sure , automation can help us find solution to the VNF related problems , so that in the future the QoS that Operators need to achieve, to be optimized.
