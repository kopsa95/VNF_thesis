We address the problem of coordinating services online over
discrete time steps $t \in \mathbb{T}$. The problem can be formalized as
follows:

\textbf{A. Problem Inputs}

We consider a substrate network $G=(V,L)$ of distributed nodes connected by non-directed links. Each node $u \in \mathbb{G}$ has a compute capacity $cap_u \in \mathbb{R}$ (e.g CPU).
Each $link=(u,u') \in \mathbb{L}$ connects two nodes $u$ and $u'$ bidirectional with certaind delay $d_t \in \mathbb{R}$ and a maximum data rate $cap_t \in \mathbb{R}$ that is shared between both directions.
We will also need to declare the Service Functions (SF) in order to apply the algorithms with deterministic processing delays.
Last we configure the NFV simulator, in order to have the fully solution deployed for testing - researching.
