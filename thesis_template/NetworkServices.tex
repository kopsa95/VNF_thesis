Communication Service Providers (CSPs) go beyond simply providing network connectivity for their enterprise customers. They also offer additional services and network functions like Network address translation (NAT), Firewall, Encryption, Domain Name Service
(DNS), Caching, etc. Traditionally, these network functions were deployed using proprietary hardware at the customer premises. This approach provides additional revenue but
deploying multiple proprietary devices is costly and makes upgrades difficult (i.e., every
time a new network function is added to a service, a truck roll is required to install the
dedicated new hardware device). Consequently, service providers began exploring ways to
reduce cost and accelerate deployments through Network Function Virtualization (NFV).
